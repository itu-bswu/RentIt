\item[User] We use more than one definition of the word ``user" in both development and in this report. Depending on the context, a user can be either someone programming up against the service or an end-user of the client.
\item[End-User] End-users are the users renting movies through the client and service.
\item[Content Publisher] Content publishers are movie owners who want to make movies available on the service.
\item[System Admin] With our current design, system admins do not have many actions available to them - they are intended to administrate the system.
\item[User Story] Something a user of our system wants to be able to do.
