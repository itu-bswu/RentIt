\chapter{Testing}
\label{testing}
In this chapter we discuss our testing strategy, our results and what we feel we could have done to improve our testing overall. 

\section{Strategy}
\label{testing_strategy}
Our testing strategy consists of different kinds of tests and a tight integration with how our user stories work in Scrum development strategy. We have four different kinds of tests: Automaticaly generated tests, Scenario tests, Service tests and GUI tests. 

Almost all functionality in our RentIt system is implemented by user stories. A user story is not accepted until tests of the functionality pass and the tests have been reviewed by the team member responsible for QA. The team member responsible for testing is Jakob Melnyk, unless he is the one who has made the tests. To us, this ensures an acceptable level of peer review of the system.

Scenario tests are done without using the service.
