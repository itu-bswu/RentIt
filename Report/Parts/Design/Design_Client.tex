\subsubsection{Usability}
\label{Design_Client_GUI_Usability}
When we sat down to design our GUI, we felt that it was important that we had a user friendly interface, we therefore choosed to make some usability tests (see \ref{Testing_Strategy_Usability}) since they will allways grant some degree of usability if performed correctly.
From these test we got the feedback that we didn't have enough user confirmation, so we therefore incorporated alot of dialogboxses into our design.

 we first made some paper mockups\footnote{see appendix for mockups}, which focused on the aspect of a very clean environment, with the least amount of redundent data, and buttons. When we then asked the test subjects how they felt about the interface, we then got the feedback that there was to little confirmation in the interface they felt uncertain that there changes was being saved or whatever they had rented a certain movie. When then took that feedback into account and went about making a digital alpha version\footnote{see appendix for screenshots} of interface which had alot more dialogboxses than the paper mockups.


 which we used to make the first round of usability tests. From the first test we got the feed back that our system didn't give the user enough feedback in form of dialogboxses and save changes buttons, when then took that into account and started working on a alpha client which we could use for the second test.
