(* There is ONE error in the code below - and it never terminates   *)
(* If you correct this one error - everything will work just fine   *)
(* You must explain the error as a comment here:                   
   The add function (line 256) was called with a 0 instead of a 1, 
   so it never changed the position of where the cards were matched. 
   This means that the cards constantly were matched on the first
   position (0, 0), where no other cards were around it.  This would
   always succeed, and therefore it kept piling the cards on top of
   each other, and therefore it never terminated.                   *)
