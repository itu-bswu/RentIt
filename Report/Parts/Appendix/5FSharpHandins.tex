\chapter{F\# Handins}
\label{Appendix_FSharp}
This chapter of the appendix contains our handins for the F\# assignments. To make sure they could fit on the pages, we had to break up some of the lines in the code. We do feel that we have been able to make it look decent, however. The original .fs files have also been included on the DVD including with the report.
