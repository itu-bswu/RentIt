\section{Collaboration}
This chapter will focus on how we worked together as a group, how we worked with the SMU team, what problems we ran into and what could have been done differently.

When we began the project, we decided on using the agile form for development known as "SCRUM". SCRUM is a development form where the team works in "sprints", which are a period of time in which the team is supposed to work on certain features. These features are called "user stories", which consist of a name, a short description and an estimation of how much time it takes to complete the story. Each user story descirbe a feature that the team is supposed to develop over the current sprint, and they can be prioritised by the product owner if the product owner wants a certain feature finished before another feature.

SCRUM also contains daily meetings/stand-up meetings, in which everyone from the team stands up and tells what they have been working on since the last meeting, what they intend to work on until next meeting and if anything can prevent them from doing this work. These meetings gives the team a good overview of what's been finished, and what still needs finishing. Furthermore, it gives the team an opportunity to discuss problems that have been encountered, and how to solve these problems.

Another important part of SCRUM is the so-called "retrospective". At the end of every sprint, each teammember writes down some good and bad things that happened during the sprint. These points are all gathered, and discussed by the team, after which the team decides on what points to improve during the next sprint. This allows the team to become improve over time, which, in the end, leads to a better project, both in terms of finished product, but also in terms of how the team works together.

\section{ITU group structure}
\label{Collaboration_ITU}
Having decided upon using SCRUM for our project, we had to distribute the roles we wanted to use. More precisely, we had the following 4 roles to distribute: 
\begin{my_description}
\item[Product Owner]
The Product Owner is the person/company who has ordered the product. Normally, this would be a specific person or company, but in our case that isn't entirely true. Techinically, our lector is the one who has "ordered" the product, which normally would make him te product owner. However, we also had the Singaporeans to take into account, as they had a say in how the product was supposed to work, as they were supposed to be able to use it as well.

In the end, we decided that the Product Owner should be a combination of our lector along with out Team Leader, as they are the ones who confirm whether the product lives up to the demands.

\item[Team Leader]
The Team Leader is responsible for making sure that people get their stuff done on time, making sure that people show up to the agreed time, making sure that the team is functioning well, etc. The Team Leader is basically responsible for the whole team. If the Product Owner has a problem with regards to the team, he should contact the Team Leader and let the Team Leader take care of it.

In our team we had two candidates for the Team Leader; Niklas Hansen and Jakob Melnyk. After some talking, Jakob decided to let Niklas get the Team Leader role, as it turned out that it wasn't something he was very interested in anyways.

\item[SCRUM Master]
The SCRUM Master is responsible for ensuring that the SCRUM process is used as intended. A key part of his role is to keep the team focused on the user stories, and makre sure that the team isn't distracted by outside influences. In our group, we also decided to let the SCRUM Master take control during the daily meetings, the sprint plannings and the retrospectives.

For our SCRUM Master role, we decided upon Frederik Lysgaard, as he was the one who showed the most interest in the role.

\item[QA Responsible]
The QA Responsible is responsible for taking a look at stories that have been finished, and making sure that they work as intended. This includes running tests that have been written for the story by the teammember who was responsible for the development of that specific story.
The QA role was given to Jakob Melnyk because he is very good at making sure that things work as are they are supposed to.
\end{my_description}

The second thing we had to do with regards to roles, was to decide whether we wanted the roles to rotate on a certain basis, or just let people keep the roles until the end of the project. After some discussion, we decided to keep the roles static. Had we changed them every so often, it would cause confusion for both us and the other group, which is why we decided to keep the roels static.

\subsection{Meetings}
\label{Collaboration_ITU_Meetings}
As mentioned in the descruption of SCRUM, meetings are an important part of SCRUM. This meant that we had a lot of focus on meetings, which will be discussed in this section.

In the beginning, we decided to meet on Mondays from 12.00 to 14.00, and Tuesdays and Thursdays from 12.00 to 16.00. Later on, we decided to meet every day except Friday and Sunday, from 10.00-16.00. When we met during these times, we'd start off with a stand-up meeting, where we told each other what we had been working on since the last meeting, and what we intended to work on until the next meeting. After the stand-up meeting we would begin working on our tasks.

Stand-up meetings weren't the only kind of meeting we had, though. Every second Tuesday we would have our retrospective meeting, in which we would discuss how the sprint had gone, and what we could improve on. Using these meetings, we kept improving our work, both with regards to how we worked, but also with regards to the quality of out product.

The last type of meetings we used, were the sprint planning meetings. On these meetings we would take a look at new stories, estimate them and prioritise them, according to which stories our product owner wanted finished first. We would then assign the stories to team members, after which we would working on them. The sprint planning meetings were also used to take a look at our status, see how many stories we had completed in the previous sprint, and how many that were left. The ones left would be prioritised higher in the next sprint, so we could have them finished and begin working on new ones.

\section{SMU cooperation}
\label{Collaboration_SMU}
We were to work in teams on the ITU side, but that wasn't the only teamwork that was to be done in this project. It was planned that we should collaborate with a group from Singapore Management University during the project. This meant that another ``dimension`` was added to the project, as we suddenly were to communicate with people whom we had never met, and whose skills we knew nothing about. It turned out to be more of a challenge than expected, as we learned during the course.

We were introduced to the SMU team the 6th of March, where we agreed on using Google+ Hangout (video conference tool) as our method for communicating during meetings. For communication that did not relate to the meetings, we agreed on using email, as it's an efficient tool for communication. It also has the advantage that everything that is sent back and forth is documented, and thus can be looked at at a later date, if need be.

\subsection{Meetings}
\label{Collaboration_SMU_Meetings}
The abovementioned meetings were scheduled to be every Thursday around 13.00-15.00 depending on the day.We had a total of 5 meetings with the SMU team <reference to meetings in appendix>, in which would update each other on how we were doing, after which we would begin talking about what our plans were until the next meeting. The meetings were also used for sharing ideas about what both groups wanted the service to be able to do.

\subsection{Conflicts}
\label{Collaboration_SMU_Conflicts}
Working with the SMU team was quite a new experience for us, as no one from our team had worked with a team from that far away before. The only expetations we had, were from what we had been told during the lectures. Therefore, we had hoped that working with the SMU team would be relativly painless, and it looked like that was the case at the beginning. But as time went by, we ran into different problems with regards to working with the SMU team, which will be discussed here.

\subsubsection{Mood Changes}
\label{Collaboration_SMU_ConflictsMood}
The use of Google+ Hangout as a video conference tool improved our communication during the meetings. Unfortunately, it did not mean that we were able to predict some of the ``mood changes'' that the Singaporeans had. During our meetings we'd agreed with them on something, and the next day we'd receive a mail saying ``can we do it this way instead? '', with their suggestion usually being something completely opposite of what we had agreed on. Whenever this happened, we'd end up having an email conversation with the Singaporeans, and in the end we would come to a solution that both sides would agree on.

\subsubsection{Wrong API}
\label{Collaboration_SMU_ConflictsAPI}
This wasn't the only problem we encountered with regards to communication. They had spent some time looking an API over before they sent us an email with questions about it, and when we received the questions we had no idea what they were talking about. Somehow, they had managed to find an API that wasn't ours, and they had been looking at that one instead of ours. This lead to confusion and a mail conversation, but in the end we managed make them look at the correct API.

\subsubsection{Misconception}
\label{Collaboration_SMU_ConflictsMisconception}
On our end there was also some misconception with regards to what they were capable of, with regards to programming. We thought that they were about our level when it came to programming, but it turned out that they weren't. This meant that some things were not done correctly on their end, which resulted in extra work for both ends, along with a lot of extra emailing between the two groups.

\subsubsection{Behind schedule}
\label{Cooperation_schedule}
This is not to say that they created all the problems, as we had some problems on our side as well, problems which impacted their side. For example we had some database issues at the beginning of the project, which pretty much prevented us for developing anything for a week. The database issue put us behind schedule, and because of that, the Singaporeans were put behind schedule.

\subsubsection{Error reporting}
\label{Cooperation_error}
The fact that the Singaporeans were put behind schedule turned out to be a major problem, as they were rather slow to report when they encountered problems. Towards the end of their schedule, they were unable to make our service work for them, and they didn't tell us until they were approaching their own deadline. We managed to solve the issue, though it could have been handled a lot better and faster if we had received their report earlier.

\subsection{What we could have done differently}
\label{Collaboration_SMU_CouldHave}
All of the abovementioned problems can be said to have happened because of one problem: Bad communication. Not only in the sense that there wasn't much communication between the groups in general, but also in the sense that we talked ``past`` each other. As stated at the beginning of this chapter, we use SCRUM on the ITU side, and from our second meeting with the SMU team, we thought  they were using SCRUM as well. However, during the process, it felt like they were using another form for SCRUM than we were, if even that, as they wanted to implement the full service at once, instead of working on it over time. 

This problem, along with a lot of the abovementioned problems, arose because of bad communication, and could easily have been prevented. If we had spent an hour talking with the SMU team, we would have been able to figure out how exactly they were running their project, and we could have told them how we ran our project. This way we'd know what to expect from each other, and we would have an easier time figuring out how to help each other when needed.

Another thing we could have done as well, was simply to communicate more. We didn't have that much communication with the SMU team overall. The largest part of our communication happened during the meetings, and over the email conversations after each meeting, where questions were asked and answered. Between the meetings, the amount of conversation was fairly small, which of course meant that we didn't know how the SMU team was doing.

The last thing we could have done differently, was to be more insistent when it came to getting updates from them. We sent some mails to them once in a while, asking for status on their end, without recieving an answer. This lead us to believe that everything was fine on their end, which it turned out that it wasn't.	

In short, more, and better, communication from the beginning would have done wonders for the project as a whole.
