\label{Preface}
This report is the result of a project on the bachelor in Software Development at the IT-University of Copenhagen spanning from the 2nd of February 2012 to the 23rd of May 2012. \\The project was given on the fourth semester of the bachelor and corresponds to 15 ECTS-credits.

The project ("Software Development in Large Teams with International Collaboration") is described as centered on developing and implementing a rental service for digital media. The is goal is to develop a client-server solution backed by a relational database system. \\Students work in the teams of four to six people and collaborate and negotiate with students from Singapore Management University (SMU) in English.\\This specific project was done by five ITU students who collaborated with three SMU students.

The challenges of this projects were:
\begin{my_itemize}
\item Dealing with cultural gaps and time differences in communication with team members from Singapore.
\item Sharing a balanced amount of information to have successful collaboration.
\item Reaching agreements that both ITU and SMU students found satisfactory.
\item Conducting constructive feedback on fellow students work.
\item Constructing a client/server solution in C\#.
\end{my_itemize}
Whenever we reference the Bibliography (found on page \pageref{Biblio}), we use the signature \cite{WoT} to indicate such. \cite{WoT} refers to the link to a blog describing "The Way of Testivus".

\section{Scrum tracker, version control and service info}
\label{Preface_Trackers}
We use Git (at GitHub) as our version control system.

In addition, we use a free tool called Pivotal Tracker to track our user stories for the Scrum\footnote{Further detailed in our \ref{Collaboration} chapter on \pageref{Collaboration}.} development model we have chosen to use.

We have set up a server to let us publish a test copy of our service (and database). We use this service to automate tests of the client and the service interface.
